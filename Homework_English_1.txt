First question: " Why should we hire you? "

- I think I am a great candidate for this position because I am a fast learner, i have learned German language in 2 years. I am a motivated and responsible person , if I recieve a task , I do my best , I find an information from differnet sources , i am very attentive to detail.I am stress-resistant.I think that I am a great team worker , I try to find an approach to every person and to bring our joint work to success.

Second question: " Can you share a weakness ? "

I'm a perfectionist and sometimes I find it difficult to share my work if I know that it is not perfect enough.I can be shy with new people, because I have no experience in IT sphere and i can be afraid to say something wrong.

Third question: " Tell me about your last job ? "

I worked my whole life as a pianist and piano teacher. I was responsible for differnet children and I prepared a lot of kids for international piano competitions.


I am sorry , that my text is so short , next time i will take more time for doing my second homework.

Thank you!
